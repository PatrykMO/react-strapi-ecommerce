The goal of this project was to create an eCommerce clothing website using ReactJS, Stripe, Strapi, and SCSS, showcasing our skills in web development, UI/UX design, and payment integration. Users will be able to browse and purchase clothes in a visually appealing and user-friendly virtual store. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, while providing a secure and seamless payment experience with Stripe integration. Additionally, Strapi is utilized as a headless CMS to manage and organize product data, and SCSS is used for styling to create a visually cohesive and appealing design. The website is designed to provide a personalized and immersive shopping experience for the user.
